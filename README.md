Native C static recompilation of **Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island (SNES, USA, Rev 1.0)** into a standalone native PC executable with native [recomp-ui](https://github.com/RetroPortingToolKit/recomp-ui) graphical launcher using the [snesrecomp](https://github.com/RetroPortingToolKit/snesrecomp) framework.

## What "static recompilation" means here

The 65816 CPU assembly code from the original ROM is statically translated to pure native C — every function the game executes on the main SNES CPU is compiled as real C translation units located in `src/game/`.

**The rest of the SNES is not recompiled — it is hardware**:
* **SuperFX (GSU-2) Coprocessor**: Yoshi's Island's flagship coprocessor executing 3D Mode 7 island rotation, boss transformations, and dynamic sprite scaling with cycle-accurate synchronization against the main 65816 CPU.
* **PPU (Picture Processing Unit)**, Mode 7 matrix transforms, HDMA raster effects, and sprite rendering run through an optimized C hardware implementation in `snesrecomp/runner/src/snes/`.
* **APU (Audio Processing Unit)** and the SPC700 audio coprocessor run asynchronously with native sample resampling and anti-starvation buffers.

This follows the established architecture of modern static recompilation projects: **recompile the CPU, emulate the silicon**.

## Current Status & Features

- [x] **Native recomp-ui GUI Launcher**: Integrated Game, Controls, Video, and Audio tabs with persistent configuration.
- [x] **Fully Playable**: Tested and verified end-to-end from intro sequence, Mode 7 3D title screen, save file selection, forest cutscenes, through in-game stage gameplay.
- [x] **Native 60 FPS**: Exact 60.0988 Hz hardware pacing using sub-millisecond precision accumulators.
- [x] **SuperFX (GSU-2) 3D & Morphmation**: Hardware-synchronized coprocessor execution powering 3D Mode 7 island rotation, boss transformations, and dynamic sprite scaling.
- [x] **Cycle-Accurate HDMA & Scanline Raster Pipeline**: Precise mid-scanline beam latching eliminating phase shift artifacts, comb-teeth tearing, and palette flickering.
- [x] **Single-Player Controller Mapping**: Full plug-and-play support for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch Pro, and standard USB/Bluetooth gamepads with deadzone tuning and `keybinds.ini` persistence.
- [x] **Strict ROM Verification**: SHA-256 and CRC32 verification, supporting both Headerless (`.sfc`, 2,097,152 bytes) and Copier-Headered (`.smc`, 2,097,664 bytes) formats.
- [x] **Portable SRAM Saves**: Battery backup saves automatically located in `saves/save.srm` with seamless backward compatibility.
- [x] **Self-Contained Executable**: Statically linked runtime libraries requiring only `SDL2.dll` alongside `YoshisIslandRecomp.exe`.

## Native Launcher Guide

Running `YoshisIslandRecomp.exe` opens the graphical launcher:

* **Game Tab**: ROM status inspection, file browser, launch button, and "Skip Launcher" option.
* **Controls Tab**: Input source selection (Keyboard, Gamepad, Both), left analog stick deadzone setting, and key remapping.
* **Video Tab**:
  * **Aspect Ratio**: `4:3 (CRT)` (default), `8:7 (Square pixels)`, `1:1 (Square frame)`.
  * **Window Scale**: 1x through 6x integer window scaling.
  * **Fullscreen**: Borderless desktop fullscreen toggle.
  * **Linear Filtering**: Smooth interpolation vs crisp sharp pixels.
* **Audio Tab**: Master volume slider (0% to 100%) and mute toggle.
* **Command Line**:
  * `--launcher`: Force opening the launcher UI even if Skip Launcher is set.
  * `--rom <path>`: Direct path to ROM file.
  * `-h, --help`: Display command line usage.

## SRAM Save Compatibility

Battery-backed cartridge saves (64 KB / 65,536 bytes) are managed under `saves/save.srm`.
* When launched, the host checks `saves/save.srm`, falls back to legacy `save.srm`, and safely migrates existing saves without destructive overwrites.
* The game auto-saves every 300 frames (~5 seconds) and flushes state upon clean exit.
